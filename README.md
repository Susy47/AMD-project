# Project 2: Market-basket analysis
The task is to implement a system finding frequent itemsets (aka market-basket analysis). The detector can consider as baskets:
 the strings contained in the review/text column of the Books_rating.csv file, using words as items;
the set of books reviewed by a same user, using books as items.
