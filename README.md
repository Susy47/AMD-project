# Project 2: Market-basket analysis
The task is to implement a system finding frequent itemsets (aka market-basket analysis). The detector can consider as baskets:
 the strings contained in the review/text column of the Books_rating.csv file, using words as items;
the set of books reviewed by a same user, using books as items.

The report should contain the following information:
the chosen dataset, and the parts of the latter which have been considered,
how data have been organized,
the applied pre-processing techniques,
the considered algorithms and their implementations,
how the proposed solution scales up with data size,
a description of the experiments,
comments and discussion on the experimental results.
